# This is an empty project for my class where I cannot use HAL drivers
1. After cloning if the compile commands are not there for some reason do:
`bear -- make -j`
2. To set up a gdb server do:
`st-util -p 4242`
3. To run gdb do:
`arm-none-eabi-gdb -tui`

I absolutely will forget what all the compile flags mean, it just makes my editor happy.
